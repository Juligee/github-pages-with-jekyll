# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
  *This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

Format: ![Alt Text](url)
  
t's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath â€” love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji!
