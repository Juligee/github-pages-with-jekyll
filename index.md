# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
  *This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

#Markdown - Bold, Italics, Link

_You **can** combine them_

Format: ![Alt Text](url)
  
t's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

#Markdown - Images

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

#Markdown - Extras

GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath â€” love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item 
Example markup
- [x] Additional markup is supported, including @mentions, #references, [links](url), **emphasis**, and <del>HTML tags</del>.
- [x] List syntax is required.
  - You can nest lists below, too!
- [x] This item is completed.
- [ ] This item is not complete.

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji! :smile:
